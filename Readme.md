# Scripts

This is a list of my personal scripts, only made to make sure my projects are all consistent

### Requirements

#### Bash 4

Install executing the following command

```
brew install bash
```

## [ReactNetCoreScript.sh](https://github.com/JoseviAgullo/scripts/blob/master/ReactNetCoreScript.sh "ReactNetCoreScript.sh")

It creates the basic folder structure for a project with a Backend based on .Net Core and a Frontend based on React

Appart from that, it installs and configures Eslint and Prettier to make sure that the code looks good (only at the Frontend)
