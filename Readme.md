# Scripts

This is a list of my personal scripts, only made to make sure my projects are all consistent

## ReactNetCoreScript

It creates the basic folder structure for a project with a Backend based on .Net Core and a Frontend based on React

Appart from that, it installs and configures Eslint and Prettier to make sure that the code looks good (only at the Frontend)
